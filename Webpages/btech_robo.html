<h1> B. Tech. Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (RAI) </h1>
<p>
The Robotics and Artificial Intelligence (R&AI) undergraduate programme is an amalgamation of multiple disciplines of engineering such as Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering. R&AI programme introduces the main technologies underlying the development of Robotic and Intelligent systems, including Machine Learning (ML) and AI, that sense and interact with their physical environment. AI empowers the robots making them more efficient to perceive learn and make decisions like humans. Industries are going through the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) which utilizes Robotics and AI to perform the data intensive and repetitive tasks for achieving human robot collaboration. Hence, the need for a skilled workforce in industries with knowledge of Robotics & AI is in growing demand.

<p>
The students will get trained in the areas of robotics and AI through the well-structured curriculum designed with the participation from the industry experts and the academicians. Students will get an opportunity to study and implement multidisciplinary concepts such as machine vision, machine learning, edge computing, IoT, Cobots, and Industry 4.0. The coursework such as mathematics for intelligent systems, fundamentals of AI, Deep learning, Big Data Analytics, Reinforcement Learning, etc., equip students with the abilities to implement several AI projects to hone skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving and practical implementation of AI in robotic technologies.
Students also get an opportunity to avail of student exchange programs at other universities where similar research on AI is being focused. The interdisciplinary lab experience gained by the students through the projects and group activities imparts the necessary knowledge to fetch either a job or admission to higher studies aspired by the students.
</p>
<p>
After completing the program, the students will have strong knowledge of designing, developing, and testing algorithms for implementing AI in robotic systems for industrial and societal applications. The graduating students can design highly efficient machines and human-friendly interfaces for intelligently automating robotic systems addressing the modern challenges in automation. In addition to the core engineering courses, the students are given exposure to imparting human values and life-long learning skills.
